# AISoftwarePopularity

AI is becoming more and more prevalent in todays society. AI has been adapted to written works, self-driving cars, and even robots.
Recently however, there have been many posts and threads regarding AI and its ability to create art from key words or phrases.
I started this project to see just how popular some of the art generating AI software has been since they have gotten more attention.
Since you would have to search these applications in order to download them or use their services, I decided to look at the popularity of each of these AI products as search terms in google trends. This allows me to catch the people that would both use the products and ones that are looking up the software for relevant news. In order to do this, I went to google trends and searched the top AI software that is used to generate art.

This is the result:

As we can see based on the graph, there is a lot of activity with several products being clearly ahead of others in terms of popularity. Dall-E and Midjourney are the two examples that stick out the most. 
DALL-E used to be the top most searched AI software until Midjourney took the lead in July 8th of this year. The initial interest in DALL-E might have been due to the fact that it generated amazing images and was created by OpenAI which is an impressive and popular AI company. However, the rise in Midjourney may be due to influence from content creators as well as its accessibility. 

Many people on YouTube, Twitter, and other social media websites were posting generated art which usually involved other creators or just visually impressive or interesting artwork. 
Another big bump for Midjourney was around August 30th where there was a very popular post online about an individual who submitted artwork that was generated by Midjourney AI to a competition and ended up winning. This sparked a debate online which surely increased the interest in Midjourney and led it to its higher popularity on google trends.
